## Scripts

Here's a brief description of the scripts available in this repository:

1. `hello.sh`: A simple script that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

2. `hora_atual.sh`: Prints the current time.

3. `read.sh`: Uses the read command to say Hello to a given name.

4. `exit_code.sh`: Demonstrates the exit code.

5. `two_input_args.sh`: Prompts two numbers which will be used to display the sum of them.

6. `system_report.sh`: Prints a system report using some unix commands

Feel free to explore each script and modify them according to your needs. These scripts are meant to serve as a starting point for learning shell scripting.
